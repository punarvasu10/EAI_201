# Model Limitations and Ethical Considerations

*Generated on: 2025-11-08 13:45:02*

## Data Limitations
- Limited historical data availability
- Synthetic data used as fallback affects model realism
- Missing player-level statistics and injuries data
- No consideration of coaching strategies or tactical changes

## Model Limitations
- Binary classification oversimplifies tournament complexity
- No accounting for tournament format changes over time
- Cannot capture team chemistry or motivational factors
- Static analysis without real-time tournament dynamics

## Football Specific Challenges
- High inherent unpredictability of football matches
- Impact of referee decisions and luck factors
- Host nation advantages not fully modeled
- Knockout stage randomness in single-elimination

## Ethical Considerations
- Predictions are probabilistic estimates, not guarantees
- Should not be used for gambling or betting purposes
- Potential bias towards historically successful teams
- Educational and analytical use only
