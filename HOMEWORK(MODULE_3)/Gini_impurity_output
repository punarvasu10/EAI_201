Dataset:
Student 1: 2 hours → Fail
Student 2: 4 hours → Fail
Student 3: 6 hours → Pass
Student 4: 8 hours → Pass
Student 5: 10 hours → Pass

Step 1: Possible splits: [3, 5, 7, 9]

Step 2: Calculate Gini impurity for each split
Split at 3: Left=[0], Right=[0, 1, 1, 1], Weighted Gini=0.300
Split at 5: Left=[0, 0], Right=[1, 1, 1], Weighted Gini=0.000
Split at 7: Left=[0, 0, 1], Right=[1, 1], Weighted Gini=0.267
Split at 9: Left=[0, 0, 1, 1], Right=[1], Weighted Gini=0.400

Best Split is at: 5 with Gini: 0.0

Decision Tree:
If Study Hours ≤ 5 → Predict: Fail (0)
If Study Hours > 5 → Predict: Pass (1)

Predictions:
Study 1 hours → Fail
Study 3 hours → Fail
Study 5 hours → Fail
Study 7 hours → Pass
Study 9 hours → Pass
Study 11 hours → Pass
